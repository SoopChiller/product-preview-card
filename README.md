## My process
sketch out a rough draft on ipad creating and filling containers 

sketched out what I thought I might need to alter for the mobile design

I attempted to keep my HTML as organized and semantic as possible. 

LOTS of room for improvement. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I had yet to use a media query prior to this project. 

After falling down quite the media query rabbit hole, I emerged with a decent understanding.

Again, will defintitely need improvement.

### Continued development

semantic HTML and responsive designs!
